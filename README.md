# rh-sso-vertx-demo
Project for demonstrating Red Hat SSO Integration with a sample Java Web Application and a Vert.x API

There are two applications hosted here. 
1) A Simple Java Web Application.
2) A Simple Vert.x based API Service.

The idea is to demonstrate SSO Integration from Red Hat Single Sign On Server and these two applications.
